          <p class="article-paragraph">
            <span class="first-word">When</span> you arrive at San Candido
            you’ll see a station flooded with bikes, bikes, and more bikes. This
            is the starting point of the 25 mile ride. Keep driving until you
            see rental shops that will have parking for you. We have rented from
            2 different spots both times we paid the same price. If you want a
            helmet bring your own the shops don’t have them. Keep in mind you’re
            hardly on the roads and the locals know to look out for you.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Now it was time for us to hit the pavement. The sun on our skin,
            looking at the endless rolling green hills donned with homes, we
            were humbled by the mountains to our right. On our left we can hear
            the sheep that are close to the fence watching as we go by. The
            picture I took of the cows was hilarious because I reached around
            what I thought was a fabric fence to take the picture and was given
            a slight shock. The jolt extra energy for the ride. The beginning is
            the most congested. Just remember if you want to take pictures move
            you, and your bike on to the grass to be courteous of the others.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Our first time on the trail we asked where to stop and get food, the
            bike shop owner suggested Loacker. We assumed it was a cafe with
            really good “biscuits,” we’re so American. We were on the look-out
            going through every town the trail took us to. When we found it we
            were shocked that it was not a cafe. Loacker makes sweets, biscuits
            meaning, wafer. This was a brand name, it was their
            distribution/headquarters. Think on the size of Keebler elves, we
            had a good laugh because we had no idea. Going inside it is sweets
            galore. Michelle and I started filling up a basket with these
            “ware-house direct prices” sweets we didn’t even know existed 5
            minutes ago. When the lady rang up €30 we had our “oh shit” moment.
            We should have had lunch in their café before buying the sweets.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Going back outside we fill up on gelato then fill up our water
            bottles. You’ll know you’re getting closer to Austria when there are
            more languages on the signs. The Italian influence on architecture
            becomes only the terra-cotta roofing. The mountains begin to
            dwindle, this part you're more or less in the woods rather than out
            in the open. Not to say it isn’t beautiful because it most certainly
            is. Do not fret because at some parts you’re right at the foot of
            more mountains.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            When you cross the border and make it into Lienz you feel a great
            deal of accomplishment. Riding 25 miles from one country to another,
            riding through the mountains, and the woods. Welcoming you is the
            “Benvenuti A Lienz” sign. Ask to take the picture for a group, and
            they will return the favor. After you get the perfect angle hop back
            on your bike and follow the signs to the city center.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Lienz is a beautiful city. So many people from all over come to
            visit. You can have lunch at any number of restaurants or cafe’s.
            There are some really talented street performers, some of which have
            very “unique” acts. There is great shopping too, this is where I
            bought my beloved Bugatti Italian Leather boots. I wear those
            suckers all over Europe. Once you're done head back to the train
            station.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            This is one of our favorite trips it requires all the senses, pumps
            the blood and makes you stay mindful. We will without a doubt take
            every visitor on this trip. Michelle’s mom had a great time and said
            it was an easy ride. Also if you are a dependent and waiting for
            your Soggiorno and can’t leave Italy at the time there are no guards
            on the trail doing passport checks so go have some fun and explore.
