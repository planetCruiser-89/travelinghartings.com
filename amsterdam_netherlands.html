    <h2>Amsterdam, Netherlands | July 24, 2018</h2>

    <div class="divider article"></div>

    <div class="flex-wrapper">
      <div class="centerizer">
        <article>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            <span class="first-word">Reunited</span> once again, this would be
            our last trip together while Michelle completes her 3 month long
            manning assist in Spanghdalem, Germany. This is a trip I was waiting
            for quite some time now. This would be my first trip to Amsterdam,
            and Michelle’s second trip. From food tours, to a live sex show,
            here is what we did in Amsterdam.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            My flight started in Treviso airport at 14:55 and I would land in
            Frankfurt Main at 16:20. This was the cheapest flight I have ever
            taken costing a whopping €23 (about $26) to get there. Now Ryanair
            is the no frills airline. Ryanair will try to nickel and dime you
            any way that they can. But they really are your best option,
            especially if you want to use all them euros on your experiences.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            I don’t do well with sitting at home waiting for a flight so I left
            early for the airport. Each time I have went to Treviso the security
            line was very long. Just remember even on “30 Rock” Jack (Alec
            Baldwin) says “there are no rules, it’s like check-in at an Italian
            airport.” It’s true, I have seen people cut lines. I have seen
            people crowd the boarding gate like it’s a cafe counter. I even saw
            someone smoking on a plane on the way to Dublin (you can read about
            that here(Link Dublin page).
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            ON THE WAY BACK WE HAD TO WAIT 10 minutes to board because we beat
            the crew to the plane. So here I am packed in a shuttle bus like a
            barrel of herrings. Minimal wind standing at the door staring at the
            plane.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            So I land in Frankfurt, and like last time I have to board a shuttle
            to get to the terminal. There is snow on the ground and I am getting
            nervous. I have a two-and-a-half hour drive to Spanghdalem and the
            temperature is near freezing. The next step was to get my rental
            car. This is when I realized I made a mistake. When I talked to the
            gentleman working he informed me the car was rented out. My pick-up
            time was for 10:00, which on their website is the default time. I
            didn’t switch it because you would think if you reserve the car that
            day they would wait. So I had to get the next model size up and pay
            €100 more. Oh well, learn from my mistakes. Learn from my mistakes.
            Next I grabbed a bite to eat I sat there watching some dude sitting
            in front of KFC wearing headphones, smoking a cigarette, and acting
            like he was in a rap video. The older lady next to him looked in
            amazement. I just couldn’t believe he was smoking in the middle of
            the food court. It was entertaining enough.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Fast forward to Spanghdalem there is snow on the ground and it’s
            dark. This base is big compared to Aviano, and more spread out. I
            get to Michelle’s and everything is good again. We had not seen each
            other since January second. We don’t stay up too late and we get to
            bed to start an early day. After a quick workout we get some road
            trip snacks (because road trip calories don’t count). Amsterdam is
            only a 4 hour drive from base and Michelle has a diesel rental car,
            and one tank lasted there and back.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            We arrive in Amsterdam and go for a drive through the city. The
            first thing you notice about Amsterdam are the bikes. Bikes are
            everywhere, regular bikes, bikes with seats for kids, bikes with
            front-end buggies for multiple kids, electric bikes, bikes, bikes,
            and more bikes. The Dutch love bikes, in-fact I would highly suggest
            not driving into the city. When you go off a main road you wonder if
            you’re in a bike lane or not. The Dutch love their bikes, and it
            shows. Just to give you a reference there are 881,000 bikes in
            Amsterdam, that’s 4 times as many cars. So the Harting’s suggest you
            do the park and go.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Amsterdam is well known for their public transportation system.
            While you are walking you will see the street trolleys, busses,
            metro, and train system. The vast network makes you wonder why
            anyone would actually own a car. From the airport to the city center
            is about an 18-30 minute ride on the metro system. It is very cheap
            and we highly suggest it rather than taking a taxi, which will run
            you quite a bit more money. So what if you drive into Amsterdam like
            the Hartings? Well Amsterdam has you covered.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            This is where the Hartings messed up, but you will learn, and save
            from our mistakes. Amsterdam offers the Park and Ride discount which
            I will link to here
            (https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/plan-your-trip/getting-around/parking/park-and-ride).
            There are a few stipulations, which we did not follow and ended up
            paying for it in the end. If you are able to complete the
            requirements then you parking will cost the change you have left
            over. If you fail to fulfill them it will cost €60 like it did for
            the Hartings, and yes it still hurts.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            We also had trouble with the public transportation because we
            purchased a ticket for the train rather than the metro, both were in
            the same station. We were looking at the train times confused on why
            we could not find our destination. After a few attempts we got it
            right, and after a transfer we were at our airbnb.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            The Hartings do not look for luxury airbnbs when we go on city
            center trips. We look for location, bed size and price, everything
            else is fluff and extra price. That is why we chose the Rembrandt
            Studio 1 it was perfect the bed was comfy, the space was clean, it
            was our pit stop for our weekend trip. That’s all you need when
            staying in a city.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            When veering off the main road into the alley we were greeted by the
            owner’s friend. As he opens the building’s door he leads us up the
            stairs Let me just point out Amsterdam builds up and has minimal
            space to work with. So when looking at the stairs it’s like looking
            up Everest. The stairs are so narrow you’ll notice hooks at the tops
            of buildings that are used for hoisting furniture in through the
            windows at the top. With the Dutch being so tall you have to wonder
            how many times they have hit their heads on the stairway arches.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            The room is beautiful, it’s cozy and well lit, the radiator was more
            than enough for the place and we only kept it on when awake. Our
            main window gave us a pleasant view of the brickwork of the building
            across the alley. Looking down you could watch the people mosey on
            by and at night you could hear the debauchery taking place in the
            alley. But like I stated we came to Amsterdam for the streets not
            the room, which was still great. All in all I would stay here again,
            and if not for Ruben we would have gotten off at a station further
            down than what we needed.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Ever since I could drink I enjoyed Heineken, the green bottle, the
            distinct taste at least from what other twenty-somethings were
            drinking at the time. And of course Hunter S. Thompson, the Gonzo
            journalist drank Heineken. Michelle missed this part of the trip her
            first time to Amsterdam allowing us to “experience” it together. The
            Hartings have toured two other breweries the Anheuser-Busch brewery
            in St. Louis, and the Guinness brewery in Dublin (you can read about
            that here).
