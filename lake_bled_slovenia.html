            <span class="first-word">This</span> trip the Hartings planned a
            weekend retreat to Slovenia, a smaller country that you can drive to
            from Italy. Slovenia feels like a mix of Italy and Austria. Tis the
            Carnival season and Slovenia has their own festivities in full
            swing. Mainly happening in the major cities of Slovenia we chose not
            to go. After some research Michelle found Lake Bled, only a two and
            a half mile drive from home. On Airbnb we found a cozy little house,
            it had a fire place, was dog friendly, and walking distance from the
            lake. The house was nested along the forest edge. Talking to some
            friends over a couple of Aperol Spritz’s they told us where to go
            and what to do.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            There was a commanders call Friday, and Michelle was being awarded
            for the hard work she did back at Maxwell. Though we had done the
            ceremony once she was actually being awarded with the real
            decoration this time. Our new friends, who are in a similar
            situation, male spouse, and a female active duty who was also being
            awarded. It is really cool seeing my wife be awarded for all the
            handwork she does. It is also cool I get to witness this part of the
            Air Force as well. The last time I went to a commander’s call Intel
            gave a briefing. I was barred from entering and those who could had
            to leave their phones and smart watches at the door. Later that
            night we went to I-sushi to celebrate. I-sushi is one of our
            favorite restaurants in Pordenone, and you rarely need a reservation
            for two.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            After sleeping in a bit we loaded the mini with clothes, wine and
            puppies. In Italy the highway is called the Autostrada the speed
            limit is 130 km/h or 80 mp/h which to be honest is a suggestion. It
            is two lanes wide and the left is strictly for passing if you need
            to pass you need to do it fast, unless someone will be right on your
            ass.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            One of the tips we got from our friends for this trip was to avoid
            the highways to avoid the fees. The autostrada has tolls, Austrian
            highways require a vignette as well as Slovenian highways. That’s
            quite a bit of cash. For this trip -or any trip- make certain you
            switch on “avoid highways” in Google Maps (instructions below).
            Besides it is an amazing drive with so me spectacular sights. We did
            not find this feature until on our way back, we relied on friends
            directions and ended up on a Slovenian highway for 6 minutes.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            traveling Northwards we marveled at the enormous snow-capped Alps.
            We felt the cold crisp air seeping through the cracked-open sunroof.
            The warm sun laying on our skin the mild scent of fresh mountain
            air. Our conversation gravitated to the fact how fortunate we are to
            live here. Some of the streets were freshly plowed and demanded a
            little more of my attention. Further North we crossed through skiing
            towns, the cars lined the street. skiers looked like ants as they
            cruised down the mountain.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            The Hartings arrived at Lake Bled and decided to do a drive around
            the lake to get a feel for the area. Some of you may remember this
            being a mistake in Amsterdam due to all the bikes and small roads,
            but not for Lake Bled this was a pleasant drive. Lake Bled demands
            full attention measuring a whopping 6,960 ft by 4,530 ft with a max
            depth of 97 ft. A small island named Blejski otok or Bled Island on
            it a church erected in honor of the Assumption of Mary stands tall.
            Looking towards the distant mountains you see Bled Castle towering
            above on a rock face. What a sight to see these elements interacting
            wit each other.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            The Hartings were in awe, the puppies were restless all of us were
            ready to get out and stretch. We punched in the address to our
            airbnb titled “A lovely house with a garden at the edge of the
            forest (LINK).” Driving up the gravel road the Hartings knew they
            made the right choice. The house felt like a wooded retreat, and
            required only a short walk to Lake Bled. We pull up to the house,
            open the car, and the puppies scramble to sniff the area. It’s nice
            to let them run of the leash because they are always on it in
            Pordenone.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Our hosts Johnny & Rachel are a younger couple who definitely
            watched that Netflix series about how to run a successful airbnb.
            Entering the house we notice two croissants, and 100% organic fruit
            and vegetable juice on the table. The croissants are filled with
            apricot jam, and the juice was amazing. This is a cute and cozy
            house. A fire place had logs ready to burn, the heater was already
            on, it was perfect. Johnny & Rachel supplied many books, and board
            games on a shelf next to the fire place. They hung a projector from
            the ceiling with a screen by the dining table. Next to the couch
            were Johnny & Rachel’s local recommendations complete with
            descriptions, numbers, and addresses. A great touch especially to
            aid tourists to steer clear of the major traps. Looking around we
            were satisfied with our decision and poured a few glasses of wine.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            The walk to Lake Bled gave us such an appreciation for the area,
            there were mountains in the distance. The houses and architecture
            were beautiful. The dogs were happy to be out and about. We come to
            the main Lake Bled entryway there are souvenir shops, clothing
            stores, antiques, and cafes. Feeling hungry we went to a friend
            recommended restaurant, not by our hosts. Walking up to Oštarija
            Peglez’n you first notice across the street on the lake side, a
            restaurant adorned with a beautiful outdoor seating area overlooking
            Lake Bled. We were told by the same friends it was not as good.
            Which usually you pay for the view with lesser quality food. However
            we should get our cakes there.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            We inside Oštarija Peglez’n with the dogs and right away they bring
            a water bowl for them. We order some draft beers, they tasted like
            cheap American light beers. We start with some soups I order the
            fish soup, Michelle ordered soup of the day, a delicious broccoli
            soup. We order the fish platter the description reads “for 2” and it
            only costs €38. They place it on a hot plate warmed by tea-cup
            candles. It’s not a platter it’s a feast. Complete with fried
            calamari, fried octopus, 2 grilled fillets, grilled squid, 2 whole
            prawn, vegetables and potatoes. The Hartings were delighted, and had
            to take most to go.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Full bellies and a new hunger to explore the Hartings hit the trail.
            Lake bled boasts a 6km or 3.728 mile path around the lake. It is
            paved but could benefit from being just a little wider. Especially
            because today there was a marathon with plenty of people jogging the
            lake, multiple times, in addition to all the other active tourists.
            Quick note don’t rent a bike it looked miserable. While circling the
            lake take note how the government has responsibly controlled the
            land use. The forest still creeps up to the trail, and hotels are
            built on the other side of the street. The land is still mostly
            unboned and kept natural. Lake Bled is a photographers dream there
            are so many elements, and you have the entire path to angle your
            shot. Every 10 steps I would say to Michelle “this is the last
            time.” I’m grateful she would stop each time. What I really loved
            taking pictures of was the church, what a subject. A tiny island
            with a rising steeple.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            We decided to wait until the next day to visit the island. There are
            three ways of getting to the island. Option one you can pay €12 to
            ride on the Pletna boat -think of a bigger Gondola- and then you can
            explore the island for about 30 minutes. Option two rent your own
            three-person row boat for €15/hour or five-person for €20/hour.
            Option three you can swim to the island. We didn’t see anyone
            swimming but it was still cold. Note: if you swim you are not
            permitted to enter the church unless you bring dry clothes.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            The church is known for hosting weddings and the tradition goes you
            carry your significant other up the 99 steps for good luck. So have
            your wheaties for breakfast. Once you enter the church you may
            wonder around. But you have to walk up the bell tower. Newlyweds
            would make a wish and ring the bell 3 times. Don’t worry you can
            still do this anytime. This costs €6 an adult or €1 a kid.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            The Hartings finally come to the end of the walk, the pups are tired
            and happy. Looking at my watch it reads cake o’ clock. That’s right
            Lake Bled is home to the famous Kremna Rezina or the Kremšnita. This
            cake is legendary. The lady that owns the cafe next to us in
            Pordenone told me about the cake, saying it’s “as big as an American
            cake.”
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            The Kremšnita’s creator Ištvan Lukačević first started preparing it
            in 1953 at the Hotel Park's patisserie. This recipe was declared a
            protected dish of designated origin in 2016 by the Slovene
            government. It’s a big deal. No matter where you went it was the
            same cake made by the same bakery assuring you were getting the
            original Kremšnita. Hotel Park’s patisserie has prepared 12 million
            cakes during the past 60 years, that’s a lot of cake. We go to the
            restaurant from earlier to buy two cakes and take them to go.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            This cake is big, I mean really big. You need a fork for sure. The
            cake consists of a thick vanilla custard base, with whipped cream on
            top, sandwich between two thin puff pastry crackers, and topped with
            powdered sugar. It has a very light taste, so light you don’t regret
            having it. Like most European sweets, it’s not overly sweet.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            The Hartings get cleaned up start the fire and open another bottle
            of wine. We try to use the projector but without USB to HDMI we
            couldn’t get the projector to work. No worries we just watched a
            movie from the phone. The dogs, exhausted from the walk had melted
            into lumps. The Hartings, cuddled on the couch. The fire, warm and
            cozy. Life, amazing and as it should be.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Our original plans were to see about getting a massage at hotel
            Rikli, recommended by a friend who was a massage therapist. Then
            depending on the time of the massage paddle out to Bled Island
            before or after. I would rather have the massage after rowing the
            boat and carrying wifey up 99 stairs. But while looking at their
            offers we made a big decision. We would skip the island and be
            pampered all day. For only €180 The Hartings would experience the
            Alpine program for two. We began disrobing and donning whit cotton
            robes, we were lead into a dark room with a huge jacuzzi. For 40
            minutes we bathed in essential oils from mountain herbs in a dark
            room. It was so relaxing
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Foregoing the swimming pool we headed for the Sauna, we were told
            you would be naked. But they gave you a sheet to wear if you wanted.
            I have never been in a sauna but it was amazing. There were about 5
            different sauna rooms, there were two steam rooms, a tiny swimming
            area, outdoor jacuzzi that bordered the edge, and one of those pine
            saunas with rocks you could pour water onto to increase the
            humidity. What an experience, I normally hate sweating but I loved
            this. After an hour it was time to head back up for our 50 minute
            massage.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            This being my second massage ever I can safely say if you have never
            had one you are missing out. Do yourself a favor go out and get one,
            you will not be sorry. We were lead down a hallway by a young man
            and a tall older woman. Michelle and the woman were in front and
            when the woman said you may enter Michelle was next to her and I was
            next to the guy. The man asks me “you’re coming with me?” That’s
            when Michelle turned around and saw the look of horror on his and
            I’s faces. We had a laugh and I went with the woman. She was tall
            and had big hands and she knew what she was doing. Michelle’s
            masseuse was respectful of her body and always checked to make sure
            she was comfortable. Within minutes I was transported to another
            dimension.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            50 minutes went by fast we were done feeling centered and
            rejuvenated. All we had to do was walk back 12 minutes and we could
            fully relax. Walking out of the Hotel Rikli we felt balanced like
            one with the Univers. Time slowed down during our ascent to the
            house, all felt right and whole. The dogs were excited to see us and
            once again we opened a bottle of wine and just existed next to one
            another in our cozy little airbnb.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Michelle found the restaurant Gostilna Pri Planincu or Inn at the
            Mountain. The restaurant was also suggested by Johnny and Rachel.
            Gostilna Pri Planincu is located in what is described as the old
            part of Lake Bled which is always a good sign when searching for
            authentic local foods. It was only a twenty minute walk and we
            brought the pups. We didn’t know if they would be welcomed but they
            haven’t been barred from any store yet.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            When entering you get that old pub vibe, not to say it looked old
            but you know it was a staple of the area. One room was a pub the
            other side was the dining area. The back was a tiny kitchen with one
            older lady working. The upstairs was it’s own pizza place and I
            assume at one time was the inn. Right away the waitress welcomed us
            in along with our dogs. She even said one of her dogs looked like
            Michonne, meaning she got some extra loving from the waitress. We
            sit down and the waitress brings out a water bowl for the dogs.
            Never in America am I right? Looking at the menu I see Budweiser
            beer, but from the Czech Republic. Thinking of Grandpa who has been
            a bud man all his life I had to order one. It comes in a big green
            bottle and it tasted like a full body Budweiser. We order a plate of
            local cheeses, and some Goulash soup to start.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            It’s all amazing I even stated how the soup tastes home-made
            something the waitress says about the food later on. For dinner we
            split a beefsteak with mushroom sauce and potatoes. I order medium
            rare not knowing that is basically what America calls rare. It’s
            delicious but I we ask to cook it just a little longer. Delicious.
            Now it’s time for dessert, Michelle can gauge people pretty well and
            asks if the dessert is worth it or if the shop we read about was
            better. The waitress explained how everything is home made and she
            highly recommends it. We ordered the apple strudel with cinnamon ice
            cream, and whipped cream. It was better than the apple pie in
            Amsterdam. The Hartings highly recommend Gostilna Pri Planincu it
            really blew the first restaurant, and cream cake out of the water.
            Full and happy the Hartings decide to walk back to our cozy little
            house, sit by the fire and finish Saturday night’s movie.
          </p>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            We started the day by packing the car and cleaning up the house a
            bit. We leave a bottle of wine for Johnny & Rachel, something we
            have never done but it felt right. They put in the extra work to
            make sure our stay was as good as possible. On the way back I
            changed the google map’s settings to correctly take us on a route
            that would avoid all highways. After a quick espresso we’re on the
            road. Puppies sleeping, wifey sleeping, and Matt driving, yep it’s a
            Harting road trip.
