A website that I began writing and ultimately lead me to this career path. 

I began making this website as my first project. This website is "mobile-responsive", includes PHP, PDO, and MySql.
As you can see there is a fair amount of pages lacking "content." As of right now I want to show off my design, and 
back-end work.

If you select the San Candido Polaroid you will find the completed page. This shows how the articles will look when available.
