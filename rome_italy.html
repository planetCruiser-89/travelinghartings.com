    <h2>Rome, Italy | July 24, 2018</h2>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Rome, the "eternal city" the one city that would always be standing
            even as the others fall. Rome is huge, there is so much to do and
            see which in my mind makes it the best city in Italy to start with.
            You can spend hours roaming the streets, walking 9 miles is the
            norm. After a full day of exploring, food, wine, you won’t have any
            problem getting over the jet-lag.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Our first trip began to Rome was during our honey moon. For whatever
            reason that I cannot remember now we were going to fly into Naples,
            go to Rome then go South to Amalfi. Once we arrived to Montgomery
            airport we realized that our flight was being delayed by 45 minutes.
            For some reason this is the norm for Montgomery airport each trip we
            are delayed at least once.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Boarding the airplane we were told we would be arriving an hour
            later to Atlanta Airport. When we land we have 15 minutes to get to
            our plane, 15 minutes to find our flight, to run to the terminal. So
            Atlanta airport is huge, so huge it has a subway to get you to the
            different terminals. We get off the plane and run, we’re booking it,
            dodging people, sweating, breathing heavily. We get to the terminal
            and we’re late. Only nine minutes late, you can still see the plane
            with the bridge connected but the door is closed. Now the Hartings
            have to do the walk of shame to the international concierge and find
            a new flight.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            What a way to kick off our honey moon. Standing in a long line,
            hoping there would be a flight available that could still get us to
            Italy in the morning like our first flight. The lady working the
            counter is nice, and tells us there is a flight to Rome that would
            land an hour later than our original flight. “There’s only one
            problem” she said “Your final destination is Naples, and not Rome.”
            They couldn’t change our final destination, but the next flight to
            Naples would be way out of the way. While the lady was trying to
            make it work Michelle laid it on thick. Michelle said “this is for
            our honeymoon,” “oh your son is active duty? So am I.” This is a
            gift Michelle has, before you know it they’re talking like friends
            and we have tickets to Rome.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Nine hours later we land in Rome, the time is 10:45. This airport is
            huge, and once again we run into some bad luck. Even though we
            missed our flight to Naples some of our luggage didn’t. We’re
            missing two bags, so here is Harting’s tip numero uno pack a change
            of clothes in your carry on. You never know when the airlines may
            lose your luggage. The lady working informed us our luggage would be
            shipped to the hotel next day. Now it came time to get to the Hotel.
            It’s now passed 12 and the hotel shuttle would not come to pick us
            up the man said “sorry sir that is impossible.”
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            I’ll be honest I can’t remember how we got to the hotel. Now living
            here I know how easy it is to take the train. You take the train in
            the airport to Roma Termini then find the station closest to your
            destination and hop on that one. Some how we arrived to the hotel
            using Google Maps without roaming. When we get to the room there was
            a knock at our door and they gave us complimentary champagne for our
            honeymoon. We pop the cork and despite the lack of luck getting
            here, we cheers to the beginning of a great trip.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Talking to concierge they informed us that the coliseum, being it
            was the first Sunday of the month, was free to enter. They handed us
            a map then activated the free gps phone for us and we were on our
            way. It was June, the sun was shining, car horns were chirping like
            birds, and we were walking. This is what you do in Rome, you walk,
            make sure to bring a really good pair of shoes. As you walk closer
            and closer to the Coliseum you have more and more people coming up
            to you. “The coliseum is this way, do you have your tickets?” “skip
            the line come this way my friend.” At one point they will have
            badges saying they are official tour ministers of Italy, that’s when
            I can’t tell if they’re bullshitting me still or not. Either way we
            planned ahead and didn’t need the assistance.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Piazza Del Colosseo is huge and you gotta take a minute to stop and
            appreciate all that is around you. The trees the architecture, the
            people, everyone is bebopping around. Tours are happening all around
            you, guys are selling water, selfie sticks, guys are trying to put
            bracelets on your wrist and then demand money. I have to laugh
            because they tricked me last time we went. A man was trying to
            talk/sell me something, as I am ignoring him he says “what you don’t
            like black people.” It caught me so off guard that I turned around,
            only to be intercepted by his accomplice “sir, sir, he didn’t mean
            it, please forgive him, here take this.” He begins to put a wrist
            band on me and asks “can you spare some money.” Michelle is
            frustrated with me that I fell for it, it happened so fast, she told
            me to”give it back.” Just stay alert, and ignore everyone.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            We wait a short amount of time to enter, and it’s shorter than you
            would expect with it being free. Walking In you’re filled with
            excitement. My brain was just going, going, going, you begin
            remembering what this place was used for. All the people who died
            fighting for their freedom, and others entertainment. It’s a really
            weird feeling being here, taking selfies, and enjoying the day. But
            now it was time for a selfie. Something we always do is offer to
            take the picture for a couple. It’s a nice gesture that leads to
            people returning the favor. We find a good spot with a couple taking
            a picture, we offer our services, “I count down 3, 2, 1 snap. I take
            a few picture, a few, like any human would do. Now it’s time for our
            picture as, we’re getting ready she snaps our picture. We look at
            the photo as they walk away and I’m not smiling. This is now one of
            my favorite photos.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            One night we did a food tour, and the Hartings will always recommend
            you do a food tour, and make it one of the first things you do.
            Chances are you’ll go in the non-touristy areas, with the best food.
            So as we’re walking to the meeting point I decide I need an
            espresso. I ask for it to be “porta via,” “take away” the barista
            looks at me like I just committed treason. She puts it in a small
            plastic cup and it’s nearly melting by the time we walk out the
            door. We meet at train station and we’re one of the first to arrive.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Once we all get there we do a meet and greet. Our tour guide said
            she was originally from another European country, she studied at
            Rome and has stayed ever since. Then the oldest couple of the group
            introduce themselves, they’re from Australia. The older man does
            most of talking for both of them, he spoke like Steve Irwin, and
            dressed like Crocodile Dundee on vacation. Then another couple from
            Australia speaks, they’re around our age and have no accents I
            didn’t catch at first either. We start hanging out with each other
            during the tour and the old man called the young one mate. Under his
            breath he said “i’m not your mate, mate” I’m floored my whole world
            is rocked. I was under the assumption all Australians talked like
            Steve Irwin. He explained how that accent is the equivalent of a
            southern accent in America, so is that kind of living. Now thinking
            about it if Steve Irwin were alive and American he’d would be
            Florida man.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Every stop we make has the best food ever. We tried prosciutto with
            cheese, paired with wine. We had pizza made from dough that rose for
            72 hours. The dinner was amazing and we were stuffed by then. The
            restaurant brought out a bottle of Prosecco for our honey moon and
            the whole table had some. What an experience. After dinner of course
            it was time for gelato. We had a crash course in gelato 101. We were
            informed on what are the signs of fake gelato… Bananas are not
            yellow, pistachios are not green, neither should be your gelato.
            Gelato is thick, and shouldn’t be piled above the container. Cookies
            and cream, or bright blue flavors are not gelato norms. Remember
            these facts and you will find the good stuff. Though in Rome the
            food quality is always poor in the tourist areas.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            The vatican, its huge, full of art, history, texts, and there is
            gold thread in the carpets that hang on the wall. There is so much
            you can’t see it in one day. We have been twice now, what I can tell
            you is the tour guide will make or brake the experience. Our first
            trip had the best tour guide, she was born to do be a guide. She was
            American and studied art history in Rome and decided to stay. Our
            second tour was hosted by a Frenchman who was trying to speak
            English. He talked so softly you thought he was afraid to wake the
            excitement within. Two different experiences, two different
            companies. I will focus on the first tour.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            We went with CitySightseeing Roma, you can find it by looking for
            the big red double decker busses. Our tour came with a guide and
            “skip the line,” it is absolutely needed in peek tourist season, not
            so much during off tourist season. Upon entering you are given a
            receiver and headphones to wear allowing you to hear your tour guide
            amongst all the noise, it’s noisy, and there are a lot of people 5
            million a year, up to 20,000 a day just in the sistine chapel. It’s
            so many that guards will rope off rooms, and reopen others all day
            just to keep the flow going.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Our tour guide did not focus on the aspect of religion as much as
            the history, what the art meant, and how it affected Italy. Her
            catchphrase was “everything came together, Hunky-Dory Kumbaya.” She
            talked in emphasis on the art, I mean that was her degree, it’s
            fascinating to hear the details. She spoke with emphasis and
            passion, you could tell she loved doing this and she was in her
            flow. At the end we were so happy with her we wanted to give her a
            tip, she out-right refused saying “go buy a beer and cheers in my
            name.” I was so disappointed with the second tour, I really couldn’t
            tell you any facts from him.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            That was our honeymoon trip to Rome, and a little bit of the second.
            What an experience to be in such an ancient city. To walk where some
            of the most famous people have. To touch the foot of a statue as
            millions have before you. It really puts your life in perspective
            that we’re all just a really small part of something larger, whether
            it’s the Earth, Universe, or Religion, you will feel something
            visiting Rome, and the Vatican.
